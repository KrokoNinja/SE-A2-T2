Positive logical test case:
Pre-condition: base > 0 and all elements in the scores array are greater than 0
Input: scores={5, 10, 15}, base=5
Output: (5/5) + (10/5) + (15/5) = 4
Post-condition: baseScore = 4

Negative logical test case:
Pre-condition: base <= 0
Input: scores={5, 10, 15}, base=-1
Output: baseScore = 0
Post-condition: baseScore = 0

Positive concrete test case:
Pre-condition: base > 0 and all elements in the scores array are greater than 0
Input: scores={5, 10, 15}, base=5
Output: (5/5) + (10/5) + (15/5) = 4
Post-condition: baseScore = 4

Negative concrete test case:
Pre-condition: all elements in the scores array are less than or equal to 0
Input: scores={0, 0, 0}, base=5
Output: baseScore = 0
Post-condition: baseScore = 0
