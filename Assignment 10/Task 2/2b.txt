b)
The minimum number of different test cases needed to achieve 100% statement coverage would be 2.
One case for the first if-statement on line 3 to be evaluated as true and another case for it to be evaluated as false.
This way, every line in the code will be executed at least once, thus achieving 100% statement coverage (C0).
